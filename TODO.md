# TODO

- Support ARM64/AARCH64 by upgrading to Glimmer DSL for SWT 4.22.2.1
- Issue with Stopping Metronome and then Changing Beat Count replaying Metronome while keeping Stop button showing Play logo (like it did not play)
- Start and Stop menu items (ensuring they are in sync with toolbar buttons)
- Mute menu item (ensuring they are in sync with toolbar buttons)

- Change font
- Disable beats

## Maybe

- Consider renaming Beat Count
- Let user add accents to beats
- Let user change volume
- Support more elaborate rhythm specification in the future like 4/4, 8/8, 7/4, or 7/8
- Make updates from 6 beat count to 64 beat count happen faster after first time (by caching/hiding canvases instead of disposing them)
- Update display name in packaged app from Glimmer to something else (like GMetronome, GlimmerMetro, Glimmetronome, Glmetro, or something better)
- Limiting number of bars played as a form of practice session (e.g. practice 100 bars everyday)
