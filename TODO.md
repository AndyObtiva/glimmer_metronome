# TODO

## Maybe

- Consider renaming Beat Count
- Let user add accents to beats
- Let user change volume
- Support more elaborate rhythm specification in the future like 4/4, 8/8, 7/4, or 7/8
- Make updates from 6 beat count to 64 beat count happen faster after first time (by caching/hiding canvases instead of disposing them)
